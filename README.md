# ðŸ¤– AI Text Summarizer - Intelligent Document Processing Web Application

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

The AI Text Summarizer is a sophisticated web application built with Python and Streamlit that leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically generate concise, meaningful summaries from large text documents. This intelligent system supports multiple file formats and offers various summarization algorithms to meet diverse user needs.


## ðŸ”¬ Technical Architecture

### **Core Technologies:**
- **Framework**: Streamlit for interactive web interface
- **NLP Library**: NLTK for text processing and tokenization
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn for TF-IDF vectorization and clustering
- **Graph Algorithms**: NetworkX for PageRank-based TextRank implementation
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts and analytics
- **File Processing**: PyPDF2, python-docx for multi-format support

### **Summarization Algorithms:**

#### 1. **Frequency-Based Extractive Summarization**
- Analyzes word frequency distribution across the document
- Calculates sentence importance scores based on constituent word frequencies
- Selects top-ranking sentences while maintaining original context
- **Use Case**: General purpose summarization for most document types

#### 2. **TextRank Extractive Summarization**
- Implements Google's PageRank algorithm for sentence ranking
- Creates similarity graphs between sentences using TF-IDF vectors
- Applies iterative ranking to identify most central sentences
- **Use Case**: Academic papers, research documents with complex relationships

#### 3. **Simple Abstractive Summarization**
- Extracts key phrases using advanced TF-IDF analysis
- Generates new summary sentences by combining important concepts
- Creates more human-like, flowing summaries
- **Use Case**: Business reports, news articles requiring readable output
